#Data Types
1. int; int; int; string; int; int; float; float; int; long; int

2. 
- Value type holds value; Reference type holds memory address.
- Value types are store in stack memory while reference types are stored in heap memory.
- Reference type will be collected by garbage collector when reference is cleared.
- Value type can be created by struct or enum while reference type can be created by class, interface, delegate or array.
- Value type can't have null values but reference type can.

- Boxing is converting from value type to reference type; Unboxing is converting from reference type to value type.

3. Managed resources indicate anything managed by CLR. Unmanaged resources are managed outside of CLR.

4. Garbage collector allocate and release memory to save memory space and improve performance

#Controlling Flow and Converting Types
1. It throws an error.

2. It returns infinity.

3. It throws an error.

4. x = y++ assigns value of y to x first, then increments y; x = ++y increments y first, then assigns the incremented value to x.

5. Breaks jumps out of the inner most loop; Continue restarts an iteration from the inner most loop; Return ends all the loops.

6. Initiailization; Condition (required part); Iteration Expression

7. = is assignment operator, == checks equality.

8. Yes it compiles and it became an infinite loop.

9. In a switch expression, underscore represent all the other cases.

10. An object must implement IEnumerable<T> interface to use foreach statement.
